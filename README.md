# Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python-(Coursera)-

These are my suggested solutions to the Coursera online course: Applied Social Network Analysis in Python., offered  by University of Michigan. I took this online course as a part of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) policy as laid out by my university, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

This course focuses on basics of graph theory and and introduces the famous Python library "NetworkX" which serves as the primary library for preparing, visualising and understanding graphs as well as their applications in real life.

Please note that these are not ideal solutions for the problems given out.
